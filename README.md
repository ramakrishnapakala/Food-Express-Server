💫 Test the FoodExpress Server Locally in your FoodExpress React App then use this domain name (`http://localhost:3000/`) if the Server is running on a `3000` Port:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:3000/api/restaurants?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING`
);

const data = await response.json();
```

## 🔮 Deploy the FoodExpress server

Once you have tested the FoodExpress server locally, you can deploy it to a production environment by following these steps.

1. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Click on the `New +` button and select `Web Service` from the dropdown menu.
3. `Connect` to your own GitHub repository (node server that you have created your own) which you want to deploy.
4. In the `Settings` tab, scroll down to the `Environment Variables` section and add `PORT` environment variables to `3000`.
5. Wait for the deployment to finish. Once it's done, you should see a success message and a link to our server URL. For Instance: `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com`
6. Click on the link URL to test our server.

Note: Now that our server is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) you can change the API URL in react app to the domain in which the server is deployed. For instance: if your server is hosted in `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com`, in the react app while sending a request to API, use this domain name :

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://YourOwnServerName.onrender.com/api/restaurants?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING`
);
```
